# shadow-plugins-extra

This repository holds additional plug-ins for Shadow, including a basic "hello world" example useful for developing new plug-ins.

# quick setup

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
CC=`which clang` CXX=`which clang++` cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`readlink -f ~`/.shadow
make -jN
make install
```

Replace `N` with the number of cores you want to use for a parallel build.

```
# for newweb: by default build only plugins; to also build native binaries
CC=`which clang` CXX=`which clang++` cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`readlink -f ~`/.shadow -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_NATIVE_BINARIES=yes

# to build only native binaries, skipping plugins, use

-DCMAKE_SKIP_PLUGINS=yes

```

# cmake options

The `cmake` command above takes multiple options, specified as

```bash
CC=`which clang` CXX=`which clang++` cmake .. -DOPT=VAL
```

+ SHADOW_ROOT = "path/to/shadow/install/root" (default is "~/.shadow")  
+ CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = "Debug" or "Release" (default is "Debug")  
+ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = "path/to/install/root" (default is ${SHADOW_ROOT})  

For example:

```bash
CC=`which clang` CXX=`which clang++` cmake .. -DSHADOW_ROOT=/home/rob/.shadow -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rob/.shadow
```

# troubleshooting

First try rebuilding to ensure that the cmake cache is up to date

```bash
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
```

using `VERBOSE=1` for more verbose output

```bash
VERBOSE=1 CC=`which clang` CXX=`which clang++` cmake ..
make
```
